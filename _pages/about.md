Hey there! I'm the founder of a startup with a passion for programming that started back in high school. My journey has taken me through a variety of industries, from diving into Financial Services at TCS to playing with some really cool tech during my Master's at the University of Toronto- think AR glasses and Muse EEG headbands! I even got to help out a computer vision startup called nLux. After grad school, I shifted gears to work on car infotainment systems, where i flexed my Linux and Android muscles. Then, I dipped my toes into contracting, implementing Odoo CRM for different clients. These days, I'm all about AI and ML, learning through Coursera and other platforms, and I'm super excited to bring these new skills into my development work!
