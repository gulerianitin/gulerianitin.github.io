I am curious about technology and future of humanity. I have a Masters in Computer Engineering from University of Toronto, Canada with supervisor as Prof. Steve Mann.

I primarily explore and work on all  aspects of emerging technlogy, be it AI or Wearable Computing. In my free time, I like to explore topics in Mathematics and Physics. Also, I have interest in different musical genres and realism based entertainment.
