# Open Source ERP Odoo implementation


 <a href="https://www.odoo.com" target="_blank">Odoo</a> is a suite of open source business apps that cover all your company needs: CRM, eCommerce, accounting, inventory, point of sale, project management, etc. Odoo's unique value proposition is to be at the same time very easy to use and fully integrated.

I implemented Odoo for a manufacturing business based in India. The modules for building sales, marketing, finance, websites, manufacturing and production were used to move the offline business data to online.

For initial software testing, I cloned an open source version using docker on my local machine and tried several modules. The implementation involved setting up the modules and training staff in three countries. It also involved migration of software from one stack to another.

Overall, it led to easier setup and monitoring for the business and streamlined processes.
