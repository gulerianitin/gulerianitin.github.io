The **Ford Trailer app** is a feature integrated into Ford vehicles, specifically designed to assist drivers with towing trailers. Its main goal is to simplify the often complex task of connecting, towing, and managing trailers. Here’s a breakdown of its core functionalities:

1. **Trailer Backup Assist**: This feature helps drivers when reversing a trailer. By turning a knob on the dashboard, the system controls the steering while the driver manages the gas and brake pedals. It uses sensors and cameras to guide the trailer in the desired direction, eliminating the need to think in reverse when backing up.

2. **Trailer Profiles**: Drivers can save profiles for different trailers. This includes details like trailer length, weight, and type (e.g., utility trailer, boat trailer). This allows for quick setup when switching between trailers, and the vehicle adjusts accordingly to optimize handling.

3. **Tire Pressure Monitoring**: The app can monitor the tire pressure of the trailer itself (if equipped with sensors). This is critical for safety, as improper tire pressure can lead to blowouts or uneven wear.

4. **Light Check**: Before hitting the road, the app helps drivers check if the trailer's lights (brake, turn signals, etc.) are functioning properly. This can be done by the driver alone, with the app automatically cycling through the lights while the driver observes.

5. **Trailer Sway Control**: If the trailer starts to sway while driving, the system can apply selective braking and reduce engine power to help stabilize the trailer.

6. **Blind Spot Monitoring for Trailers**: The app extends the vehicle’s blind spot monitoring system to cover the length of the trailer. This gives drivers warnings if another vehicle is in their blind spot when towing a long trailer.

7. **Weight Distribution Information**: The app can assist drivers in distributing the load in the trailer more effectively to ensure safe handling. This helps to avoid overloading the rear of the trailer, which can lead to sway or imbalance.

8. **Checklists**: The app often provides pre-trip checklists to ensure that all necessary steps for safe towing (such as checking hitch connections and inspecting trailer brakes) are completed before driving.

These features are designed to enhance safety, reduce the stress associated with towing, and improve the overall driving experience for Ford owners who tow trailers.

I worked with certain features and bug fixes in this app.
