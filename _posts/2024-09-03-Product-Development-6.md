# Product Design and Development tips

## Hackathons

I participated in many Hackathons such as PayPal Hackathon, Dementia FB Hackathon, Epson Moverio AR Hackathon and IBM SportsHackathon, Meta SpaceGlasses (YC 12) Hackathon. 

* For most hackathons, it is usually one or two day duration to prepare the prototype.
* The objectives are usually shared beforehand and also on online hackathons on devpost. 
* The rapid prototyping involves some sort of plan to divide taks among teammates
* It is usually small team of 2 to 4 people per team and the demo involves a technical team and business person as well. 
* The demo at the end of the product shows technical and conceptual provess of the team in utilising the softwares provided.
* The final presentation and business concept and execution matters more than pure technical know how.
* With the rise of tools like Chatgpt, it accelerates the development time.



## Startups
I was the Chief Product Officer at nLux, a smart facial lighting startup and worked as a consultant for Altius Analytics


* Startups generally have fast iterations on product design and development.
* After initial product market validation , the intial product from concept to launch requires faster iterations.
* They need quick development of the product utilising technologies like 3D printing, AutoCAD in physical products and bypass core platform technologies like Kotlin, Swift in favour of cross platform React-Native to go to market quickly.
* The design team, manufacturing, product team, engineering are carried out by small number of people work together to develop the product in iterations in an agile or non agile manner.
  

## Large Corporations
I have worked at large Corporations such as CITI Financial as a client while at TCS, GM, Ford Motors as a client at Wipro.


* Large Corporations have multiple departments that take care of product design and development.
* Big companies with greater emphasis on design and aesthetics have tightly integrated teams in design, marketing, manufacturing and engineering.
* Different companies are in different hierarchy for this process. Some have top-down decision making, others have distributed decision making.
* There is a top architect that usually designs the high level architecture. Design and Manufacturing teams come up with feasibility study.
* They have strong Patenting process which is faster than filing individually.
