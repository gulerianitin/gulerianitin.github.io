Odoo at VEPLOdoo is an open source ERP system that provides the functions of an ERP at a reasonable cost.It has modules for building sales, marketing, finance, websites, manufacturing and production. I was able to clone an open source version using docker on my local machine and test  python based application stack.
The implementation involved setting up the modules and training staff in three countries. Odoo stack is relatively new.
