At GM , I worked on the cadillac cue infotainment system. We worked on the AOSP Android open source project.  We worked on a fork of android approximately 2014 acquired from  Harman Kardon. Automotive industry consists of a lot of vendors. The infotainment system looks simple when fit into a car but it is made of many hardware modules.The main parts like that of a computer are the motherboard like Intel or Texas instruments. There are many modules for separate functions like climate control like HVAC systems , massage for chair
I worked with the Settings application. It is similar to phone ,s settings application which controls the entire infotainment settings. 
The development of user stories were quite straightforward. But fixing bugs was not trivial. There were many bugs that belonged to other teams as the settings app interfaced with other apps.
The vehicle simulator was a windows based application that had CAN signals to simulate a vehicle signalling.  This utilised skills in C# based application. 
I utilised it as part of my green belt six Sigma project. Automation of some parts of the simulator resulting in 40% reduction in defect fixing time.
Other parts of the project utilized building AOSP in Linux environment. Overall, this required powerful machines.
